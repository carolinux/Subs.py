1
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,978

I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,079

This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,623

I feel like you're going to 
pull over and snuff me.

4
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,125

What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,422

We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:40,295

- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,562

Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't 
have called that.

8
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,103

I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't 
that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,969

- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,804

You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,674

I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,543

Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,451

- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,215

Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,449

That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,991

March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,994

but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,963

Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,899

- Is it cool if I take 
a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,837

All right.

21
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,034

I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,701

Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,369

No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,449

Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,586

Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. 
Don't change any settings.

26
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,251

- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,022

What have we got?

28
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,356

Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,490

- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,364

Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,842

- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,440

Whoa!

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,188

Tony Stark.

34
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,129

Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,864

American patriot.

36
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,094

Even from an early age,

37
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,636

the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:36,265

quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,811

At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,039

At age six, his first engine.

41
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,550

And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,919

Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,424

Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,928

steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,463

until, at age 21, the 
prodigal son returns

46
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,934

and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

47
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,368

With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,236

Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,368

creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, 
satellite targeting.

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,313

Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,214

by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,844

and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,528

As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,863

I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,699

He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,403

Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

57
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,776

to present this year's Apogee 
Award to Mr. Tony Stark.

58
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,317

Tony?

59
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,195

- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,967

This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,508

This is wonderful.

62
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,379

Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:28,379

But if I were Tony, I would 
tell you how honored I feel

64
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:33,453

and what a joy it is to receive 
this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,325

Tony, you know...

66
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:39,329

The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,796

He's always working.

68
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,302

Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,401

- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:56,777

- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:57,849

- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,817

if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,785

Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,583

- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,525

- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:06,820

- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

77
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,257

- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,658

Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

79
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,321

I don't have any of those
floating around.

80
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,490

We're gonna let it ride!

81
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,727

Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

82
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,929

Okay, you, too.

83
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,903

- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

84
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,497

There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

85
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,837

Two craps. Line away.

86
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,741

- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

87
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,245

I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

88
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,803

- This is where I exit.
- All right.

89
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:30,882

Tomorrow, don't be late.

90
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,211

- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

91
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,580

I know, I know.

92
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,178

Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

93
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,858

Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

94
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,460

Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

95
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,623

Can I ask you a couple of questions?

96
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,200

- She's cute.
- She's all right?

97
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,335

- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,370

- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

99
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,268

You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

100
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,206

- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

101
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,867

And what do you say
to your other nickname?

102
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,138

"The Merchant of Death"?

103
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,736

That's not bad.

104
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,646

- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

105
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,284

Well, Ms. Brown,

106
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,822

it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

107
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,619

I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

108
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,887

I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

109
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,019

Rehearse that much?

110
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,790

Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

111
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,230

- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

112
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,563

All I want is a serious answer.

113
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,864

Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

114
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,371

"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

115
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,738

That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

116
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,607

My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

117
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,272

A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

118
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,542

would call that being a hero.

119
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,811

And a lot of people would also 
call that war profiteering.

120
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,046

Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

121
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,883

by advancing medical technology

122
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,321

or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

123
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,656

All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

124
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,162

You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

125
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:55,130

I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

126
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,008

Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

127
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,745

The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

128
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,252

The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

129
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,791

High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

130
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,105

Tony?

131
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,877

Hey, Tony?

132
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,933

You are not authorized
to access this area.

133
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,767

- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

134
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,902

I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

135
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,740

and there's a car waiting for you outside

136
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,110

that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

137
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,940

- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

138
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:25,455

After all these years, Tony still 
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

139
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,890

I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

140
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,758

including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

141
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,922

Will that be all?

142
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,473

Give me an exploded view.

143
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,814

The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

144
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,448

Log that.

145
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,284

- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

146
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,383

I'll keep you posted.

147
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,224

You are supposed to be halfway 
around the world right now.

148
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,662

- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

149
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,298

Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

150
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,096

Your flight was scheduled to 
leave an hour and a half ago.

151
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,296

That's funny, I thought with 
it being my plane and all,

152
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,929

that it would just wait for me
to get there.

153
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,769

Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

154
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,933

before I get you out of the door.

155
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,273

Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

156
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,573

if it departs before you arrive?

157
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,013

Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

158
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,709

Do you want it? Yes or no.

159
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,878

Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

160
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,189

No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

161
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,519

where he lived and worked,

162
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,115

- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

163
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,561

I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

164
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,026

I need it. Buy it. Store it.

165
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,362

Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

166
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,270

Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

167
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,774

They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

168
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,344

Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

169
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,776

I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

170
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780

What are you trying 
to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

171
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,373

- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

172
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,510

I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

173
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,110

- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

174
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,655

I knew that. Already?

175
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:08,283

Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

176
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,788

- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

177
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,331

- And?
- It was very nice.

178
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,834

- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

179
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,629

You're welcome, Miss Potts.

180
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:24,809

Okay.

181
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,789

You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

182
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,368

You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

183
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,999

I got you. I got you.

184
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,537

What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,130

- What?
- Three hours.

186
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,368

I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

187
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,445

For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

188
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,037

Waiting on you now. 
Let's go. Come on.

189
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,683

Wheels up! Rock and roll!

190
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,319

- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

191
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,623

Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

192
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,426

I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

193
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:22,966

- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

194
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,194

You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

195
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,292

Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

196
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,769

- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

197
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,066

You don't respect yourself,

198
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:29,504

- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

199
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,939

I'm just your babysitter.

200
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,534

So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

201
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,806

Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

202
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,541

Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

203
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,014

- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

204
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,846

We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

205
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,353

- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

206
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,047

incapable of being responsible.

207
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,648

It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

208
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,783

Hot sake?

209
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,193

- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

210
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,628

That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,758

When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

212
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,597

you know what I recognize?

213
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:03,607

I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

214
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,704

Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

215
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,872

No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

216
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,813

Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

217
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,943

No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,637

General.

219
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,299

Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

220
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,375

Thanks.

221
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,178

Is it better to be feared or respected?

222
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,407

I say, is it too much to ask for both?

223
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:49,286

With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

224
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,151

of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

225
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,280

It's the first missile system

226
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,224

to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

227
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,263

They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

228
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,332

I respectfully disagree.

229
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,426

I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

230
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,900

That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

231
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,801

And it's worked out pretty well so far.

232
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,240

Find an excuse

233
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,644

to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

234
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:20,240

the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

235
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,501

For your consideration, the Jericho.

236
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,119

I'll be throwing one of these in

237
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,211

with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

238
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,311

To peace!

239
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,117

- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

240
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,695

I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

241
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,593

It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

242
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:10,566

Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

243
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,102

Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

244
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,762

Good night, Tony.

245
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,641

- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

246
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,677

The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

247
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,474

- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

248
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,608

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

249
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,982

What the hell did you do to me?

250
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,346

What I did?

251
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:15,421

What I did is to save your life.

252
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,323

I removed all the shrapnel 
I could, but there's a lot left,

253
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,194

and it's headed into your atrial septum.

254
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,696

Here, want to see?

255
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,200

I have a souvenir. Take a look.

256
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,103

I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

257
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,610

We call them the walking dead

258
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,876

because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

259
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,747

- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

260
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,646

hooked up to a car battery,

261
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,656

and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

262
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,992

That's right. Smile.

263
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,833

We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

264
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,899

- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

265
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,337

If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

266
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,610

much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

267
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:14,014

Where are we?

268
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,852

Come on, stand up. Stand up!

269
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,848

Just do as I do.

270
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,619

Come on, put your hands up.

271
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,830

Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

272
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,298

Do you understand me? Do as I do.

273
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,986

He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

274
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,889

"in the history of America."

275
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,854

He is honored.

276
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,131

He wants you to build the missile.

277
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,869

The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

278
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,603

This one.

279
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,684

I refuse.

280
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,429

Tony!

281
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,777

He wants to know what you think.

282
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,546

I think you got a lot of my weapons.

283
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,656

He says they have everything you 
need to build the Jericho missile.

284
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,390

He wants you to make
the list of materials.

285
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,264

He says for you
to start working immediately,

286
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,604

and when you're done,
he will set you free.

287
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,638

- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

288
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,822

I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

289
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,992

But they will never find you
in these mountains.

290
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,367

Look, what you just saw,

291
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,267

that is your legacy, Stark.

292
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,278

Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

293
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,645

Is that how you want to go out?

294
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:38,155

Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

295
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,448

Or are you going to
do something about it?

296
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,655

Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, 
you, either way.

297
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,995

And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

298
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,431

Well, then,

299
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,129

this is a very important 
week for you, isn't it?

300
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,433

If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

301
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:03,737

I need welding gear. I don't 
care if it's acetylene or propane.

302
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,009

I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

303
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:09,109

I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

304
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,934

- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

305
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,732

But apparently,
not enough for this place.

306
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,864

They speak Arabic, Urdu,

307
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:33,341

Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

308
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:38,812

- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

309
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,508

They call themselves the Ten Rings.

310
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,395

You know, we might be more productive

311
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,261

if you include me
in the planning process.

312
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,072

Okay, we don't need this.

313
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,479

What is that?

314
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,313

That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

315
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,386

We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

316
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,907

Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

317
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,670

Relax. I have steady hands.

318
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:43,169

Why do you think you're still alive?

319
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,820

- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

320
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,724

Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

321
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,459

Nice to meet you, too.

322
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,800

That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

323
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,335

That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

324
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,473

I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

325
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,542

It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

326
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,309

But what could it generate?

327
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:56,945

If my math is right, and it always is,
three giga-joules per second.

328
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,923

That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

329
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:03,050

Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

330
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,403

- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

331
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,465

Flatten them out and look.

332
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,046

Oh, wow.

333
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,707

Impressive.

334
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,710

Good.

335
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,440

Good roll. Good roll.

336
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,113

You still haven't told me
where you're from.

337
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,016

I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

338
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,557

- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

339
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:11,258

Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

340
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:13,654

And you, Stark?

341
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,963

- No.
- No?

342
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,331

So you're a man who has everything

343
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,407

and nothing.

344
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,002

Relax.

345
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,314

The bow and arrow

346
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:20,254

once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

347
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,226

It allowed the great Genghis Khan

348
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:29,032

to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

349
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,331

An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

350
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,031

and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

351
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,009

But today,

352
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:47,248

whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

353
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,150

rules these lands.

354
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:53,854

And soon,

355
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,556

it will be my turn.

356
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,203

What does he want?

357
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,131

What do you want? A delivery date?

358
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,771

I need him.

359
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,434

Good assistant.

360
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:30,243

You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

361
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:37,418

Okay? Can you move?

362
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,752

Okay, say it again.

363
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,348

41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

364
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,896

that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

365
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,625

Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

366
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,755

Say something.
Say something back to him.

367
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,195

- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

368
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,766

- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

369
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,184

- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

370
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,219

- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

371
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:53,922

- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

372
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:55,298

Okay.

373
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,594

- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

374
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:01,262

Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

375
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,933

- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

376
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,132

Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

377
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,765

- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

378
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,276

- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

379
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,074

Come over here and button me up.

380
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,310

Okay. All right.

381
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:15,715

Every other hex bolt.

382
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,913

- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

383
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,387

- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

384
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,123

Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

385
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,923

We need more time.

386
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,131

Hey,

387
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,231

- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

388
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,335

Stick to the plan!

389
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,501

Yinsen!

390
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,648

- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

391
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,891

Stark.

392
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,293

Come on. We got to go.

393
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,937

Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

394
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,940

This was always the plan, Stark.

395
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,535

Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

396
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,979

My family is dead.

397
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,045

I'm going to see them now, Stark.

398
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,952

It's okay.

399
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,026

I want this. I want this.

400
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,966

Thank you for saving me.

401
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,428

Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

402
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,479

My turn.

403
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,072

Not bad.

404
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,380

Hey!

405
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,872

How was the "fun-vee"?

406
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,577

Next time, you ride with me, okay?

407
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,407

Watch it, coming up here.

408
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,509

Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

409
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,160

Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

410
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:50,825

- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

411
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:53,694

Where to, sir?

412
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,396

- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

413
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:56,563

No? Tony, you have to

414
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:57,662

- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

415
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:59,503

- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

416
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:01,236

I've been in captivity for three months.

417
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,076

There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

418
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,149

- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

419
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,649

...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

420
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,946

- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

421
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:12,578

- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

422
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,797

Look at this!

423
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:29,865

Tony.

424
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,073

- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

425
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:36,543

Look at you!

426
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,713

- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

427
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:42,250

- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

428
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,019

Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

429
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,897

- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

430
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:56,226

Can I speak to you for a moment?

431
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,928

I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

432
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,334

I'm not a reporter.

433
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,837

I'm agent Phil Coulson,

434
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:04,668

with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

435
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,367

and Logistics Division.

436
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:09,172

- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

437
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,716

You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

438
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,446

We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

439
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,217

We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

440
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,555

- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

441
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,958

Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

442
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,470

Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

443
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:37,730

A little less formal and...

444
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:45,308

- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

445
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:47,440

I don't know what he's up to.

446
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,951

- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

447
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:52,453

I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

448
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,418

I never got to say goodbye to my father.

449
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,524

There's questions
that I would have asked him.

450
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,656

I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

451
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:08,035

If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

452
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:13,238

Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

453
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,707

I saw young Americans killed

454
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,610

by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

455
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:27,420

And I saw

456
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:33,459

that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

457
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,497

- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

458
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,234

What happened over there?

459
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,765

I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

460
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:47,242

to offer this world than just 
making things that blow up.

461
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,802

And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

462
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,543

the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

463
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:58,644

until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

464
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,279

I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

465
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,119

What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

466
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:06,252

and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

467
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:12,398

What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

468
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:15,167

And he's healthier than ever.

469
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,666

We're going to have
a little internal discussion

470
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,141

and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

471
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,610

- Where is he?
- He's inside.

472
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,358

Well, that... That went well.

473
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:41,862

Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

474
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,263

Your head? What about my head?

475
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,359

What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

476
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:50,529

- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

477
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,941

Yep.

478
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,540

Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

479
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:58,273

Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

480
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,975

That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

481
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,210

It's my name on the side of the building.

482
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,913

And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

483
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:06,955

Not based on what I saw.

484
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,192

We're not doing a good enough job.

485
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,520

We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

486
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,494

Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

487
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,762

I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

488
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:22,167

Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

489
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,633

Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

490
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,836

- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

491
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,577

The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

492
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,844

Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

493
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,078

Maybe.

494
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,114

Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

495
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,714

- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

496
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,590

Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

497
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:50,894

- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

498
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,299

- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

499
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,212

- Okay.
- Okay?

500
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,744

It works.

501
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:15,985

Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

502
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:19,323

There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

503
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,828

like your father and I.

504
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,693

I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

505
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,357

- But if I had...
- Tony.

506
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:27,459

Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

507
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,266

- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

508
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:33,034

You gotta let me handle this.

509
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,543

We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

510
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,442

We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

511
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,778

I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

512
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,813

Stark Industries!

513
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,752

I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

514
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:46,981

Sell, sell, sell!

515
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,191

Abandon ship!

516
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:52,625

Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

517
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,933

Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

518
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:04,505

Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

519
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,844

Pepper. How big are your hands?

520
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:10,606

- What?
- How big are your hands?

521
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,581

- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

522
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,014

Hey.

523
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,585

Let's see them. Show me your hands.

524
00:49:26,696 --> 00:49:27,663

Let's see them.

525
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:30,089

Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

526
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,558

I just need your help for a sec.

527
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,565

Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

528
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,198

It was. It is now an antique.

529
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,807

This is what will be keeping me 
alive for the foreseeable future.

530
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:47,508

I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

531
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,548

- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

532
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:53,986

There's an exposed wire
under this device.

533
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,184

And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

534
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:58,920

It's fine.

535
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,763

- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

536
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,628

- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

537
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:07,999

I want you to reach in, and you're 
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

538
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,863

- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

539
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,601

It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

540
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,040

the socket wall or it goes "beep."

541
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,612

- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

542
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,706

- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

543
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:25,053

You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

544
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:29,182

No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

545
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,784

trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

546
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,031

Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

547
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:38,794

- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

548
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:39,994

Okay.

549
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,932

Oh, there's pus!

550
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:50,638

It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

551
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,647

- not from my body.
- It smells!

552
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,239

Yeah, it does.

553
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,313

The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

554
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,512

- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

555
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:01,522

Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

556
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:02,591

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,023

That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

558
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,254

Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

559
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:09,297

There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

560
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,525

- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

561
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,760

Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

562
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:13,858

What's wrong?

563
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,301

Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

564
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,667

'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

565
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,537

- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

566
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:21,610

- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

567
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,742

- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

568
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:24,814

- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

569
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,542

- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

570
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:32,180

Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

571
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:39,784

Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

572
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,021

Nice.

573
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:44,361

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

574
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:45,695

You okay?

575
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,037

Don't ever, ever, ever,

576
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:53,108

ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

577
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,302

I don't have anyone but you.

578
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:01,951

Anyway...

579
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:10,758

- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

580
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:12,925

Destroy it.

581
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:14,963

Incinerate it.

582
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,257

You don't want to keep it?

583
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:21,497

Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

584
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:25,768

- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

585
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,205

Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

586
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,211

What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

587
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,476

That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

588
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,484

Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

589
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:46,924

The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

590
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:49,356

I'll tell you, in my experience,

591
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:54,198

no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

592
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,832

his insight,

593
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,931

that ability to look into a 
situation beyond the obvious

594
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,637

and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

595
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:05,737

Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

596
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,816

Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

597
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,817

- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

598
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,750

you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

599
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:14,448

at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

600
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:15,819

- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

601
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:17,290

- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

602
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:18,451

- Was it lvan?
- Don't do that.

603
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:19,789

They'll believe it. Don't do that.

604
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,022

- Okay.
- Don't do that.

605
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,065

- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

606
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,664

- I'm surprised.
- Why?

607
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,467

I swear, I didn't expect to see 
you walking around so soon.

608
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,438

I'm doing a little better than walking.

609
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,976

- Really?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,306

Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

611
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:41,415

I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

612
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:45,119

You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

613
00:53:45,254 --> 00:53:48,223

'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

614
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:49,882

that was a doozy.

615
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:54,787

This is not for the military. 
I'm not... It's different.

616
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:57,525

What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

617
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,033

- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

618
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:03,003

What you need is time
to get your mind right.

619
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,431

- I'm serious.
- Okay.

620
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:11,572

It's nice seeing you, Tony.

621
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,841

Thanks.

622
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:24,491

- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

623
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:28,662

I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark Two.

624
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:33,529

Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

625
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,236

Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

626
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,137

Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

627
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,938

Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

628
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,975

I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

629
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,622

Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

630
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,595

Next. Up.

631
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:43,136

Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

632
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,298

Stay put. Nice.

633
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,943

You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

634
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,574

Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

635
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,650

Up.

636
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,322

Screw it. Don't even move.

637
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,453

You are a tragedy.

638
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,900

Okay, let's do this right.

639
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,408

Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

640
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:28,376

Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

641
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:29,883

You, roll it.

642
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,747

Okay. Activate hand controls.

643
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,255

We're gonna start off nice and easy.

644
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,527

We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

645
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,965

And three,

646
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,825

two,

647
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,763

one.

648
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,174

Up two. All right, set that.

649
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,644

I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

650
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:33,578

Yeah, everything's... What?

651
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,809

- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

652
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,908

- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

653
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,614

Okay.

654
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,219

I thought you said you 
were done making weapons.

655
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,291

It is.

656
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:46,352

This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

657
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,627

I didn't expect that.

658
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,338

How'd it go?

659
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,270

It went that bad, huh?

660
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,006

Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

661
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:08,982

- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

662
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,952

It would have gone better
if you were there.

663
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:13,745

You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

664
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:18,350

- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

665
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:23,592

- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

666
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,134

The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

667
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,328

They're filing an injunction.

668
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:30,462

- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

669
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:31,767

Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

670
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:32,841

We knew that was gonna happen.

671
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,001

- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

672
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,306

We own the controlling 
interest in the company.

673
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:40,143

Tony, the board has rights, too.

674
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,884

They're making the case that 
you and your new direction

675
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:47,217

- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

676
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,315

That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

677
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,128

I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

678
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,220

This is great.

679
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,790

- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

680
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:02,063

Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

681
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,504

I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

682
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,166

Something to pitch them.

683
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,746

Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

684
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,973

- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

685
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,640

- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

686
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,548

- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

687
00:59:17,653 --> 00:59:19,484

Go on, here, you can have a piece.

688
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,055

- Take two.
- Thank you.

689
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,022

You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

690
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,717

Good night, Obie.

691
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:30,195

Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

692
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,961

Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

693
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,867

and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

694
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,803

All right, nice and easy.

695
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:42,810

Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

696
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,406

And three, two, one.

697
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,249

Okay.

698
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,188

Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

699
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,698

'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

700
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,461

Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

701
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,799

And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

702
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:10,496

Three, two, one.

703
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,683

Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

704
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,089

Not the car, not the car!

705
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:33,428

Table!

706
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,636

Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

707
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:08,252

No!

708
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,993

Yeah, I can fly.

709
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,741

- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

710
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,037

- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

711
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:24,169

Import all preferences
from home interface.

712
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,713

Will do, sir.

713
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:33,677

All right, what do you say?

714
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:37,247

I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

715
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,985

Can we start the virtual walk-around?

716
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,064

Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

717
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:43,461

Do a check on control surfaces.

718
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,056

As you wish.

719
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,514

Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

720
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,526

Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

721
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,095

Start listening in on ground control.

722
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:15,254

Sir, there are still terabytes

723
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,958

of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

724
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,969

Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

725
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:26,337

Ready? In three, two, one.

726
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,428

Handles like a dream.

727
01:03:19,607 --> 01:03:21,199

All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

728
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:22,708

What's SR-71's record?

729
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,576

The altitude record for fixed 
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

730
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:29,676

Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

731
01:03:32,887 --> 01:03:36,482

Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

732
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:37,649

Keep going!

733
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:41,258

Higher!

734
01:03:54,942 --> 01:03:59,208

We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

735
01:04:01,983 --> 01:04:04,315

Come on, we got to break the ice!

736
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:40,815

Kill power.

737
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:08,438

Notes. Main transducer feels 
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

738
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:12,944

Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

739
01:06:13,046 --> 01:06:15,241

A very astute observation, sir.

740
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:17,111

Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

741
01:06:17,216 --> 01:06:18,649

we should improve the exosystems.

742
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,311

Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

743
01:06:21,421 --> 01:06:24,481

Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

744
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,424

That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

745
01:06:28,528 --> 01:06:29,790

- Got it?
- Yes.

746
01:06:29,896 --> 01:06:32,194

Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

747
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:33,629

Thrill me.

748
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:39,562

Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

749
01:06:39,672 --> 01:06:43,904

where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

750
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,568

has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

751
01:06:45,678 --> 01:06:46,906

Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

752
01:06:47,013 --> 01:06:49,504

I have no record of an invitation, sir.

753
01:06:49,615 --> 01:06:51,048

... hasn't been seen in public

754
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:54,847

since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

755
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:57,716

Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

756
01:06:57,824 --> 01:07:01,419

and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

757
01:07:01,928 --> 01:07:04,658

no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

758
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:06,891

The render is complete.

759
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,661

A little ostentatious, don't you think?

760
01:07:08,768 --> 01:07:11,794

What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

761
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:16,067

Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

762
01:07:16,175 --> 01:07:19,042

Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

763
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:24,113

The render is complete.

764
01:07:24,617 --> 01:07:26,482

Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

765
01:07:26,586 --> 01:07:28,144

Commencing automated assembly.

766
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:31,417

Estimated completion time is five hours.

767
01:07:31,524 --> 01:07:32,684

Don't wait up for me, honey.

768
01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:00,580

Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

769
01:08:00,686 --> 01:08:04,417

is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

770
01:08:07,093 --> 01:08:09,584

- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

771
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,597

You look great, Hef.

772
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:15,764

We're going to have a great quarter.

773
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:19,599

What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

774
01:08:19,705 --> 01:08:23,869

Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

775
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,705

I'll see you inside.

776
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:29,577

Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

777
01:08:29,682 --> 01:08:31,377

I think I got the board
right where we want them.

778
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:35,045

You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

779
01:08:39,592 --> 01:08:43,119

- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

780
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:45,592

- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

781
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:48,294

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

782
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:51,700

Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

783
01:08:51,804 --> 01:08:53,431

God, you need a new name for that.

784
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,473

Yeah, I hear that a lot.

785
01:08:56,309 --> 01:09:00,075

Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

786
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:02,147

There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

787
01:09:02,248 --> 01:09:04,113

and time can be a factor
with these things.

788
01:09:04,217 --> 01:09:06,208

Let's just put something on the books.

789
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,652

How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

790
01:09:10,056 --> 01:09:13,287

Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

791
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:17,724

Well, I'm going to go to my 
assistant, and we'll make a date.

792
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,257

You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

793
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:23,631

- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

794
01:09:23,736 --> 01:09:25,499

- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

795
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:27,402

- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

796
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:29,634

- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

797
01:09:29,742 --> 01:09:30,970

Yes.

798
01:09:31,077 --> 01:09:32,942

- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

799
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:35,536

- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

800
01:09:45,992 --> 01:09:48,187

Am I making you uncomfortable?

801
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:53,861

No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

802
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:57,766

in front of everyone that I work 
with in a dress with no back.

803
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,595

- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

804
01:10:00,706 --> 01:10:02,571

But I could fire you if that 
would take the edge off.

805
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:06,304

I actually don't think that you 
could tie your shoes without me.

806
01:10:06,412 --> 01:10:07,845

- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

807
01:10:07,947 --> 01:10:10,415

What's your Social Security number?

808
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,649

- Five.
- Five?

809
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:17,784

- Right.
- Right.

810
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,222

You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

811
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:23,489

The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

812
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,134

- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

813
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:43,013

- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

814
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:45,913

It was totally not harmless, by the way.

815
01:10:46,152 --> 01:10:47,414

We're dancing. No one's even watching.

816
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,283

Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

817
01:10:49,388 --> 01:10:52,516

I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

818
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,992

No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

819
01:10:56,095 --> 01:10:58,893

And everybody knows
exactly who you are

820
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:02,195

and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

821
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:04,667

But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

822
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,738

- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

823
01:11:06,839 --> 01:11:09,672

Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

824
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:11,675

- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

825
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:15,543

and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

826
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:18,378

dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

827
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:35,232

- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

828
01:11:36,636 --> 01:11:39,537

- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

829
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:44,303

Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

830
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:48,237

Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

831
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,474

Make one of them dirty, will you?

832
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:57,714

Wow. Tony Stark.

833
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:00,388

- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

834
01:12:04,463 --> 01:12:04,630

- Carrie.
- Christine.

835
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,460

- Carrie.
- Christine.

836
01:12:05,564 --> 01:12:06,531

That's right.

837
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:09,294

You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

838
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:10,767

Can I at least get a reaction from you?

839
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:13,304

Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

840
01:12:13,406 --> 01:12:14,737

'Cause I was referring
to your company's

841
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,171

involvement in this latest atrocity.

842
01:12:16,275 --> 01:12:18,800

Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

843
01:12:18,911 --> 01:12:21,243

I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

844
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:23,713

I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

845
01:12:23,816 --> 01:12:26,114

Is this what you call accountability?

846
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,914

It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

847
01:12:40,499 --> 01:12:42,899

- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

848
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,393

- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

849
01:12:45,504 --> 01:12:47,438

Well, I'm not my company.

850
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:51,805

- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

851
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,242

- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

852
01:12:53,346 --> 01:12:56,645

- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

853
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:58,580

when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

854
01:12:58,684 --> 01:13:00,049

"This is how we do business."

855
01:13:00,152 --> 01:13:03,315

If we're double-dealing 
under the table... Are we?

856
01:13:03,789 --> 01:13:05,882

Tony, your picture, please!

857
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,618

Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

858
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:16,526

Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

859
01:13:17,303 --> 01:13:20,534

I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

860
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:25,704

It was the only way I could protect you.

861
01:13:28,114 --> 01:13:29,308

No. No.

862
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:41,656

The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

863
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:45,424

as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

864
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:48,532

Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

865
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,329

have been driven from their homes,

866
01:13:50,436 --> 01:13:54,668

displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

867
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:57,999

Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

868
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:00,874

they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

869
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,814

or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

870
01:14:09,622 --> 01:14:12,989

Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

871
01:14:13,092 --> 01:14:15,788

referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

872
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:19,394

As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

873
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:23,594

A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

874
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:26,361

With no political will
or international pressure,

875
01:14:26,472 --> 01:14:28,906

there's very little hope
for these refugees.

876
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:32,273

Around me, a woman begging 
for news on her husband,

877
01:14:32,378 --> 01:14:34,141

who was kidnapped by insurgents,

878
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:36,771

either forced to join their militia...

879
01:14:37,817 --> 01:14:40,411

Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

880
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:43,079

holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

881
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:46,784

A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

882
01:14:48,427 --> 01:14:50,827

There's very little hope
for these refugees,

883
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:54,764

refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

884
01:18:27,046 --> 01:18:28,741

He's all yours.

885
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:29,404

What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

886
01:19:29,508 --> 01:19:31,738

No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

887
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:33,277

Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

888
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:35,278

Get those monitors up!

889
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,677

We got a bogey!

890
01:19:36,782 --> 01:19:38,909

- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

891
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:40,951

I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

892
01:19:41,053 --> 01:19:42,680

No, it definitely is not us, sir!

893
01:19:42,788 --> 01:19:44,449

- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

894
01:19:44,556 --> 01:19:47,024

I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

895
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:49,356

- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

896
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:52,089

Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

897
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:00,666

We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

898
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:02,468

with all known databases.
We have nothing.

899
01:20:02,574 --> 01:20:04,769

Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

900
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:06,538

We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

901
01:20:06,645 --> 01:20:08,306

So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

902
01:20:08,413 --> 01:20:09,744

How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

903
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:11,816

Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

904
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,044

- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

905
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:16,517

We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

906
01:20:16,622 --> 01:20:18,419

Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

907
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:23,928

- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

908
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:29,296

- Hello?
- Tony?

909
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:31,096

- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

910
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:33,428

- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

911
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:36,406

- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

912
01:20:36,508 --> 01:20:39,944

- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

913
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:41,410

It's funny how that works, huh?

914
01:20:41,513 --> 01:20:44,880

Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

915
01:20:44,983 --> 01:20:46,610

a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

916
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:48,345

Well, that's a hot spot.

917
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:50,921

Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

918
01:20:51,023 --> 01:20:52,081

Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

919
01:20:52,191 --> 01:20:53,385

I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

920
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:55,255

- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

921
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,123

to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

922
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:59,561

You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

923
01:20:59,665 --> 01:21:01,132

- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

924
01:21:01,233 --> 01:21:03,963

- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

925
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:07,436

right now, and it's about to 
be blown to kingdom come.

926
01:21:08,173 --> 01:21:09,868

That's my exit.

927
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:18,047

Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

928
01:21:18,283 --> 01:21:19,716

Whiplash One, what is it?

929
01:21:19,818 --> 01:21:21,115

I've got no idea.

930
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:23,552

- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

931
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:24,679

Then you are clear to engage.

932
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:27,725

Hit it.

933
01:21:32,598 --> 01:21:35,567

That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

934
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:41,573

- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

935
01:21:44,643 --> 01:21:47,203

Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

936
01:22:01,526 --> 01:22:02,720

Deploy flaps!

937
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,156

Holy!

938
01:22:05,264 --> 01:22:06,822

That thing just jumped 
off the radar, sir.

939
01:22:06,932 --> 01:22:08,456

The sat visual has been lost.

940
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:10,228

No way that's a UAV.

941
01:22:10,335 --> 01:22:11,427

What is it?

942
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:13,094

I can't see anything.

943
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:15,639

Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

944
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:18,734

I think bogey's been handled, sir.

945
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:29,814

- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

946
01:22:29,922 --> 01:22:31,583

- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

947
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:32,952

You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

948
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:34,525

No, see, this isn't a game.

949
01:22:34,626 --> 01:22:37,925

You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

950
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:39,930

- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

951
01:22:40,032 --> 01:22:42,796

I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

952
01:22:42,935 --> 01:22:45,301

Rhodey, you got anything for me?

953
01:22:46,505 --> 01:22:49,872

- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

954
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,236

On your belly!

955
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:55,210

It looks like a man!

956
01:22:55,447 --> 01:22:58,075

Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

957
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:07,284

I'm hit! I'm hit!

958
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,656

It's confirmed. He has been hit.

959
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:15,800

Punch out! Punch out!

960
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,969

Whiplash One down.

961
01:23:24,076 --> 01:23:25,600

Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

962
01:23:25,711 --> 01:23:27,941

Negative! No chute, no chute!

963
01:23:33,485 --> 01:23:34,850

My chute's jammed!

964
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:43,224

Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

965
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:45,922

Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

966
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,297

Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

967
01:23:50,402 --> 01:23:52,461

- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

968
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:53,902

inside a legal no fly zone!

969
01:23:54,006 --> 01:23:56,304

Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

970
01:23:56,408 --> 01:23:58,774

You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

971
01:23:58,877 --> 01:24:00,208

Keep going!

972
01:24:07,853 --> 01:24:09,844

Good chute! Good chute!

973
01:24:17,496 --> 01:24:20,329

- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

974
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:22,992

Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

975
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:25,234

You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

976
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:29,473

Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

977
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:31,132

Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

978
01:24:31,243 --> 01:24:34,110

No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

979
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:35,803

Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

980
01:24:35,914 --> 01:24:38,405

Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

981
01:24:38,517 --> 01:24:40,212

It's not that simple.

982
01:24:41,053 --> 01:24:42,850

An unfortunate training exercise

983
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:45,821

involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

984
01:24:46,591 --> 01:24:49,958

I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

985
01:24:50,062 --> 01:24:53,964

As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

986
01:24:54,066 --> 01:24:57,558

it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

987
01:24:57,669 --> 01:25:01,765

but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

988
01:25:03,842 --> 01:25:04,900

Hey!

989
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:08,676

It is a tight fit, sir.

990
01:25:09,714 --> 01:25:12,581

Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

991
01:25:12,684 --> 01:25:14,584

Be gentle. This is my first time.

992
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,284

I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

993
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:23,288

- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

994
01:25:24,896 --> 01:25:27,160

What's going on here?

995
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:35,763

Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

996
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:38,206

Are those bullet holes?

997
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:06,898

Welcome.

998
01:26:10,308 --> 01:26:12,367

Compliments of Tony Stark.

999
01:26:13,345 --> 01:26:16,974

If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1000
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:19,141

You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1001
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:20,980

Show me the weapon.

1002
01:26:22,254 --> 01:26:25,690

Come. Leave your guards outside.

1003
01:26:42,507 --> 01:26:44,998

His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1004
01:26:47,712 --> 01:26:49,646

So this is how he did it.

1005
01:26:50,015 --> 01:26:52,483

This is only a first, crude effort.

1006
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:54,981

Stark has perfected his design.

1007
01:26:55,453 --> 01:26:57,921

He has made a masterpiece of death.

1008
01:26:58,623 --> 01:27:01,751

A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1009
01:27:03,395 --> 01:27:05,693

And you dream of Stark's throne.

1010
01:27:07,532 --> 01:27:09,727

We have a common enemy.

1011
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:16,006

If we are still in business,

1012
01:27:18,577 --> 01:27:20,738

I will give you these designs

1013
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,247

as a gift.

1014
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,315

And in turn,

1015
01:27:28,019 --> 01:27:33,082

I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1016
01:27:50,075 --> 01:27:51,406

Technology.

1017
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:56,803

It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1018
01:27:58,049 --> 01:28:01,177

Don't worry. It'll only 
last for 15 minutes.

1019
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,820

That's the least of your problems.

1020
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:12,689

Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1021
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:16,357

All right, let's finish up here.

1022
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:23,273

Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1023
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:26,867

and I'm going to want this data 
masked. Recruit our top engineers.

1024
01:28:26,978 --> 01:28:28,843

I want a prototype right away.

1025
01:28:37,055 --> 01:28:40,183

Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1026
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:42,487

I need you to go to my office.

1027
01:28:43,028 --> 01:28:45,428

You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1028
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,124

the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1029
01:28:48,233 --> 01:28:49,791

This'll get you in.

1030
01:28:49,901 --> 01:28:51,459

It's probably under Executive Files.

1031
01:28:51,569 --> 01:28:53,935

If not, they put it on a ghost 
drive, in which case you need

1032
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:56,701

to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1033
01:28:57,008 --> 01:28:59,476

And what do you plan to do 
with this information if I 
bring it back here?

1034
01:28:59,577 --> 01:29:00,601

Same drill.

1035
01:29:00,712 --> 01:29:02,703

They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1036
01:29:02,814 --> 01:29:05,874

I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1037
01:29:06,851 --> 01:29:07,875

Tony,

1038
01:29:10,221 --> 01:29:12,086

you know that
I would help you with anything,

1039
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:16,149

but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1040
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:19,822

There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1041
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:23,294

There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1042
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:27,495

There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1043
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,071

Is that so?

1044
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:33,744

Well, then, I quit.

1045
01:29:36,848 --> 01:29:38,440

You stood by my side all these years

1046
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:41,348

while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1047
01:29:41,686 --> 01:29:43,517

And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1048
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:45,418

that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1049
01:29:45,523 --> 01:29:49,960

You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1050
01:29:50,061 --> 01:29:52,029

I shouldn't be alive,

1051
01:29:53,365 --> 01:29:55,458

unless it was for a reason.

1052
01:29:56,334 --> 01:29:58,165

I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1053
01:29:58,703 --> 01:30:01,831

I just finally know what I have to do.

1054
01:30:06,211 --> 01:30:08,975

And I know in my heart that it's right.

1055
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:27,129

You're all I have, too, you know.

1056
01:31:36,601 --> 01:31:41,368

Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1057
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:58,619

You did not tell us that the 
target you paid us to kill 
was the great Tony Stark.

1058
01:31:58,723 --> 01:32:00,247

- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1059
01:32:00,358 --> 01:32:03,054

... your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1060
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:05,823

The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1061
01:32:09,868 --> 01:32:14,237

So, what are we going to do about this?

1062
01:32:26,251 --> 01:32:29,516

I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1063
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:40,925

Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1064
01:33:02,587 --> 01:33:06,956

I was so happy when he came home.

1065
01:33:07,058 --> 01:33:09,822

It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1066
01:33:12,897 --> 01:33:14,831

Now I realize,

1067
01:33:17,168 --> 01:33:20,399

well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1068
01:33:22,173 --> 01:33:24,835

He left a part of himself in that cave.

1069
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:29,203

Breaks my heart.

1070
01:33:31,549 --> 01:33:35,485

Well, he's a complicated person.

1071
01:33:38,222 --> 01:33:41,589

He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1072
01:33:47,932 --> 01:33:50,662

You are a very rare woman.

1073
01:33:53,204 --> 01:33:55,331

Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1074
01:33:58,109 --> 01:34:00,077

Thank you. Thanks.

1075
01:34:02,113 --> 01:34:04,104

I'd better get back there.

1076
01:34:09,621 --> 01:34:11,612

Is that today's paper?

1077
01:34:13,291 --> 01:34:14,315

Yes.

1078
01:34:15,126 --> 01:34:16,491

Do you mind?

1079
01:34:17,128 --> 01:34:18,925

- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1080
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:20,327

Of course.

1081
01:34:23,835 --> 01:34:25,132

Take care.

1082
01:34:49,327 --> 01:34:52,194

Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1083
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:53,786

Nope, right now. Come with me.

1084
01:34:53,898 --> 01:34:54,990

- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1085
01:34:55,099 --> 01:34:56,862

- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1086
01:34:58,069 --> 01:35:00,230

I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1087
01:35:01,806 --> 01:35:04,604

Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1088
01:35:05,009 --> 01:35:08,501

Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1089
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:11,408

Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1090
01:35:11,516 --> 01:35:13,746

what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1091
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:15,512

- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1092
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:19,420

Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1093
01:35:19,657 --> 01:35:22,785

- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1094
01:35:22,894 --> 01:35:28,855

William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1095
01:35:28,966 --> 01:35:32,925

Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1096
01:35:33,037 --> 01:35:39,601

Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1097
01:35:41,846 --> 01:35:44,872

Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1098
01:36:01,032 --> 01:36:01,999

Tony?

1099
01:36:04,769 --> 01:36:08,034

Tony, are you there? Hello?

1100
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:10,834

Breathe.

1101
01:36:12,043 --> 01:36:14,739

Easy, easy.

1102
01:36:16,848 --> 01:36:19,112

You remember this one, right?

1103
01:36:20,852 --> 01:36:23,150

It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1104
01:36:23,254 --> 01:36:27,350

There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1105
01:36:29,727 --> 01:36:30,955

Tony.

1106
01:36:33,297 --> 01:36:37,631

When I ordered the hit on you,

1107
01:36:40,271 --> 01:36:42,739

I worried that I was

1108
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,801

killing the golden goose.

1109
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:52,911

But, you see, it was just

1110
01:36:54,285 --> 01:36:56,515

fate that you survived that.

1111
01:37:01,626 --> 01:37:05,460

You had one last golden egg to give.

1112
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:14,934

Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1113
01:37:18,876 --> 01:37:23,973

Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1114
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:28,313

Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1115
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:39,956

Oh, it's beautiful.

1116
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:47,401

Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1117
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,174

What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1118
01:37:53,578 --> 01:37:55,307

This is your legacy.

1119
01:37:57,882 --> 01:38:03,047

A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1120
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:09,987

Weapons that will help steer 
the world back on course,

1121
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:12,324

put the balance of power in our hands.

1122
01:38:13,931 --> 01:38:15,523

The right hands.

1123
01:38:18,703 --> 01:38:23,197

I wish you could've seen my prototype.

1124
01:38:24,642 --> 01:38:26,109

It's not as...

1125
01:38:27,478 --> 01:38:30,447

Well, not as conservative as yours.

1126
01:38:32,516 --> 01:38:35,314

Too bad you had to involve 
Pepper in this.

1127
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:38,346

I would have preferred that she lived.

1128
01:38:51,402 --> 01:38:53,666

What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1129
01:38:53,771 --> 01:38:56,365

Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1130
01:38:57,642 --> 01:38:58,904

Okay, where's Tony now?

1131
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:00,705

I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1132
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,938

Please go over there and 
make sure everything's okay.

1133
01:39:03,047 --> 01:39:05,607

Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1134
01:40:11,983 --> 01:40:13,245

Good boy.

1135
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,148

Tony?

1136
01:40:56,827 --> 01:40:57,885

Tony?

1137
01:40:59,697 --> 01:41:00,789

Tony?

1138
01:41:02,933 --> 01:41:04,025

Tony?

1139
01:41:06,737 --> 01:41:07,795

Tony!

1140
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:12,271

Tony! You okay?

1141
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:16,271

- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1142
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,678

They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1143
01:41:18,849 --> 01:41:20,908

That's not going to be enough.

1144
01:41:44,775 --> 01:41:50,736

Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1145
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,452

My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1146
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,687

Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1147
01:42:04,795 --> 01:42:06,194

It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1148
01:42:06,297 --> 01:42:08,993

You might want to take
a few steps back.

1149
01:42:27,618 --> 01:42:30,109

That's the coolest thing 
I've ever seen.

1150
01:42:30,221 --> 01:42:32,985

Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1151
01:42:39,697 --> 01:42:42,029

You need me to do anything else?

1152
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:44,429

Keep the skies clear.

1153
01:42:49,607 --> 01:42:50,835

Damn!

1154
01:42:58,949 --> 01:43:00,541

Next time, baby.

1155
01:43:30,714 --> 01:43:34,047

Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1156
01:43:34,685 --> 01:43:36,653

I thought it'd be bigger.

1157
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,378

How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1158
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:37,777

The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1159
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:40,543

That chest piece was never 
designed for sustained flight.

1160
01:44:40,651 --> 01:44:42,141

Keep me posted.

1161
01:44:43,954 --> 01:44:44,921

Pepper!

1162
01:44:45,022 --> 01:44:48,014

- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1163
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,025

- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1164
01:44:50,127 --> 01:44:51,890

- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1165
01:44:51,996 --> 01:44:53,429

Get out of there right now!

1166
01:45:05,309 --> 01:45:07,607

Where do you think you're going?

1167
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:16,119

Your services are no longer required.

1168
01:45:16,353 --> 01:45:17,786

Stane!

1169
01:45:43,013 --> 01:45:44,674

I love this suit!

1170
01:45:44,782 --> 01:45:47,979

- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1171
01:45:49,553 --> 01:45:51,578

Divert power to chest RT.

1172
01:46:00,331 --> 01:46:02,424

Power reduced to 19%.

1173
01:46:10,307 --> 01:46:11,365

Lady!

1174
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:15,301

No, no, no, no, no, no!

1175
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:40,336

For 30 years, I've 
been holding you up!

1176
01:46:44,842 --> 01:46:47,242

I built this company from nothing!

1177
01:46:49,546 --> 01:46:52,071

Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1178
01:46:58,355 --> 01:46:59,947

Least of all you!

1179
01:47:10,334 --> 01:47:13,565

Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1180
01:47:14,171 --> 01:47:16,867

I've made some upgrades of my own!

1181
01:47:25,249 --> 01:47:27,183

Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1182
01:47:27,284 --> 01:47:28,945

Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1183
01:47:29,052 --> 01:47:31,316

With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1184
01:47:31,422 --> 01:47:33,549

I know the math! Do it!

1185
01:47:41,865 --> 01:47:44,163

Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1186
01:47:44,268 --> 01:47:46,862

Get me Major Allen. 
Scramble the jets!

1187
01:47:49,606 --> 01:47:52,575

Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1188
01:47:52,676 --> 01:47:53,904

Yes, sir.

1189
01:48:01,885 --> 01:48:03,785

- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1190
01:48:07,825 --> 01:48:09,816

- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1191
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,693

- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1192
01:48:18,802 --> 01:48:20,360

Stop telling me!

1193
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,642

You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1194
01:48:35,252 --> 01:48:37,277

How'd you solve the icing problem?

1195
01:48:37,387 --> 01:48:38,854

Icing problem?

1196
01:48:41,091 --> 01:48:43,423

Might want to look into it.

1197
01:48:55,138 --> 01:48:56,400

Two percent.

1198
01:48:58,575 --> 01:49:01,442

We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1199
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:16,526

- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1200
01:49:16,627 --> 01:49:20,757

I'm almost out of power. 
I've got to get out of this thing. 
I'll be right there.

1201
01:49:20,864 --> 01:49:22,229

Nice try!

1202
01:49:34,845 --> 01:49:38,474

- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1203
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,744

Flares!

1204
01:49:53,297 --> 01:49:55,322

Very clever, Tony.

1205
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:03,139

- Potts?
- Tony!

1206
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,207

This isn't working.

1207
01:50:04,308 --> 01:50:06,572

We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1208
01:50:06,677 --> 01:50:09,544

- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1209
01:50:09,646 --> 01:50:12,080

Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1210
01:50:12,182 --> 01:50:13,581

When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1211
01:50:13,684 --> 01:50:16,244

You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1212
01:50:16,353 --> 01:50:17,718

It's going to fry everything up here.

1213
01:50:19,923 --> 01:50:22,187

Okay. I'm going in now.

1214
01:50:22,292 --> 01:50:25,523

Make sure you wait till I clear 
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1215
01:50:35,072 --> 01:50:36,835

This looks important!

1216
01:50:57,761 --> 01:51:00,525

I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1217
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:04,727

but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1218
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:15,478

You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1219
01:51:17,881 --> 01:51:19,974

You'd have made your father proud!

1220
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:27,456

It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1221
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:48,307

Tony!

1222
01:51:49,546 --> 01:51:51,138

How ironic, Tony!

1223
01:51:52,983 --> 01:51:57,852

Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1224
01:51:58,121 --> 01:52:03,991

- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1225
01:52:07,064 --> 01:52:10,898

- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1226
01:52:11,001 --> 01:52:14,960

- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1227
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,565

- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1228
01:52:22,713 --> 01:52:24,180

Push it!

1229
01:53:21,772 --> 01:53:23,535

Tony!

1230
01:53:31,982 --> 01:53:34,075

You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1231
01:53:34,184 --> 01:53:36,448

at Stark Industries last night.

1232
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:41,314

There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1233
01:53:41,458 --> 01:53:44,018

and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1234
01:53:44,795 --> 01:53:47,025

Fortunately, a member of Tony 
Stark's personal security staff...

1235
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:49,030

"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1236
01:53:49,132 --> 01:53:52,761

I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1237
01:53:52,869 --> 01:53:55,497

but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1238
01:53:55,605 --> 01:53:57,197

Here's your alibi.

1239
01:53:58,108 --> 01:53:59,166

Okay.

1240
01:53:59,276 --> 01:54:01,403

- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1241
01:54:01,511 --> 01:54:03,604

We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1242
01:54:03,713 --> 01:54:05,408

and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1243
01:54:05,515 --> 01:54:08,609

See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1244
01:54:08,718 --> 01:54:10,481

alone on the island.

1245
01:54:11,822 --> 01:54:13,084

- That's what happened.
- All right.

1246
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,283

Just read it, word for word.

1247
01:54:17,227 --> 01:54:19,218

There's nothing about Stane here.

1248
01:54:19,329 --> 01:54:22,093

That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1249
01:54:22,999 --> 01:54:25,433

Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1250
01:54:25,535 --> 01:54:28,026

But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1251
01:54:28,138 --> 01:54:31,005

He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1252
01:54:31,107 --> 01:54:33,405

This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1253
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:37,469

Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1254
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:39,811

You've got 90 seconds.

1255
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,346

Agent Coulson?

1256
01:54:45,055 --> 01:54:49,515

I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1257
01:54:49,626 --> 01:54:52,527

That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1258
01:54:52,829 --> 01:54:56,162

- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1259
01:54:56,533 --> 01:54:57,659

Right.

1260
01:54:58,668 --> 01:55:02,536

- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1261
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,903

Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1262
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:06,565

- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1263
01:55:06,676 --> 01:55:09,110

- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1264
01:55:09,212 --> 01:55:13,171

You know, if I were Iron Man, 
I'd have this girlfriend who 
knew my true identity.

1265
01:55:13,283 --> 01:55:15,808

She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1266
01:55:15,919 --> 01:55:18,285

yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1267
01:55:18,388 --> 01:55:22,085

She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1268
01:55:23,827 --> 01:55:24,851

crazy about me.

1269
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:26,622

Tell me you never think about that night.

1270
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:28,561

- What night?
- You know.

1271
01:55:31,534 --> 01:55:37,268

Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1272
01:55:38,942 --> 01:55:44,505

and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1273
01:55:44,614 --> 01:55:47,845

and you left me there, by myself?

1274
01:55:49,085 --> 01:55:51,576

Is that the night you're talking about?

1275
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:54,848

Thought so.

1276
01:55:57,594 --> 01:56:01,325

- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1277
01:56:01,431 --> 01:56:04,923

And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1278
01:56:05,035 --> 01:56:08,061

He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1279
01:56:12,275 --> 01:56:17,338

Been a while since I was in 
front of you. I figure I'll 
stick to the cards this time.

1280
01:56:19,349 --> 01:56:22,375

There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1281
01:56:22,485 --> 01:56:23,747

on the freeway and the rooftop...

1282
01:56:23,853 --> 01:56:26,617

I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1283
01:56:26,723 --> 01:56:30,454

that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1284
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,654

- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1285
01:56:33,763 --> 01:56:37,358

It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1286
01:56:37,467 --> 01:56:40,698

to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1287
01:56:40,804 --> 01:56:42,396

I never said you were a superhero.

1288
01:56:42,505 --> 01:56:47,807

Didn't? Well, good, because that 
would be outlandish and fantastic.

1289
01:56:49,846 --> 01:56:53,077

I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1290
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:56,585

With this laundry list
of character defects,

1291
01:56:56,686 --> 01:56:58,119

all the mistakes I've made,

1292
01:56:58,221 --> 01:57:01,554

- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1293
01:57:01,658 --> 01:57:03,285

Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1294
01:57:05,428 --> 01:57:06,918

The truth is

1295
01:57:13,136 --> 01:57:14,603

I am Iron Man.

1296
02:05:17,854 --> 02:05:19,082

Jarvis!

1297
02:05:19,188 --> 02:05:20,883

Welcome home, sir.

1298
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:29,821

"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1299
02:05:30,199 --> 02:05:33,430

Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1300
02:05:33,536 --> 02:05:35,299

You just don't know it yet.

1301
02:05:35,838 --> 02:05:37,567

Who the hell are you?

1302
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,502

Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1303
02:05:42,645 --> 02:05:45,580

I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
