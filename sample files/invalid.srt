00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:54,815

<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

2
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:58,153

<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

3
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:05,038

<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

4
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,688

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

5
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,775

<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

6
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:14,653

<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

7
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,198

<i> Yes.</i>

8
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,827

<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

9
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,726

<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

10
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,286

<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

11
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,821

<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:29,445

<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

13
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,000

<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,956

<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

15
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:43,341

<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

16
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,401

<i>largely public.</i>
