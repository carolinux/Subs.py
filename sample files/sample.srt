00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,447

<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:05,785

<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:12,670

<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,320

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,407

<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:22,285

<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

7
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,830

<i> Yes.</i>

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,459

<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,358

<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,918

<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

11
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,453

<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,077

<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,632

<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:47,588

<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,973

<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

16
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:53,033

<i>largely public.</i>
