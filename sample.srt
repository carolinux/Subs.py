00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,727

<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

2
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,065

<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

3
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:09,950

<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

4
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,600

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

5
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,687

<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

6
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:19,565

<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

7
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:21,110

<i> Yes.</i>

8
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,739

<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

9
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,638

<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

10
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,198

<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

11
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,733

<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,357

<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

13
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,912

<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:44,868

<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

15
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,253

<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

16
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,313

<i>largely public.</i>
